\begin{frame}{Problem}
  \textcolor{tugreen}{\Large Problem:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How effectively can we predict bird species by analysing sound files using a convolutional neural network (CNN)?
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{3mm}
  \textcolor{tugreen}{\Large Motivation:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Classifying and observing different species of birds is of great interest for wildlife research
    \item But often you don't see the birds themselves and only hear their calls
    \item Differentiating bird species by sound recordings requires expert knowledge and is very time consuming
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A CNN could be used to automatically identify different species by audio recordings
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dataset}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Source: \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition/}{\textcolor{blue}{kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition/}}
    \item Dataset contains sound recordings of several thousand bird species from around the world 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For each species there are $\sim \num{100}$ .wav files of different length
      \item The recordings contain background noises etc. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Additionally, a .csv file with metadata for all recordings is provided
    \item The dataset was used in a competition in 2020
    \item Original data from \href{https://xeno-canto.org/}{\textcolor{blue}{xeno-canto.org/}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A website for sharing and classifying wildlife sound recordings
    \end{itemize}
    \item Each audio file is licensed individually by its author
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The individual licenses are listed in the .csv 
      \item Usually they are licensed as \textit{Creative Commons}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comparison with alternative method}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using a CNN is the most obvious and most promising approach for such a problem 
    \item An alternative method could e.g. make use of a \textit{KNN} classifier
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{2mm}
  \textcolor{tugreen}{\large Strategy:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Extract meaningful features from the audio files 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Spectral analysis using \textit{FFT} or \textit{Lomb-Scargle}
      \item Most prominent frequencies, average frequency ... 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Train k-nearest neighbours algorithm 
    \item Compare performance
  \end{enumerate}
  \vspace{2mm}
  \textcolor{tugreen}{\large Performance measure:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy / F1-score
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
