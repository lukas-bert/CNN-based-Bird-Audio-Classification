# CNN-based-Bird-Audio-Classification
 A machine learning project for the ML Seminar 2024 at the TU Dortmund (faculty of physics). 
 
 A convolutional neural network is employed to classify audio recordings of calls from different bird species.
 Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/monogenea/birdsongs-from-europe
 based on data uploaded on https://xeno-canto.org/ 

 Installation:
 To install all necessary packages run:
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
 for CPU installation or
    conda env create -f env_gpu.yaml
 for GPU installation (also requires a manual installation of CUDA 12.1 and cuDNN 8.9.7).
 
 Some notebooks are outdated and will not run in this environment.
